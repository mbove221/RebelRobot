This repo houses the final working version for ESE 224: Advanced Programming and Data Structures.
Led a team of 2 in designing a Robot class, Rebel Robot class, and a Room class, yielding 800+ lines of code.
Utilized various ADTs like queues, stacks, linked lists, and binary trees. Employed linked lists for queues, connecting
each room through a single binary tree structure. Leveraged stack ADT for object data storage and reading 1 data file,
determining tree structure and room structure (e.g., robots per room, number of children).
Applied 2 operator over loaded functions and developed getters/setters for customizable Rebel Robot/Robot data.
Implemented Spread Rebellion function to generate a probability to change the next robotâ€™s data type to a rebel.
